			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Revenue was growing, but the underlying systems couldn’t keep up. KPI tracking was manual, inconsistent, and disconnected from the CRM. Reps regularly “updated” their numbers with the admin right before standups. Managers couldn’t tell which metrics were real, and reps didn’t know what good looked like. Forecasts were based on instinct, not pipeline math.</p><br>
			<p>I replaced the entire system with a live, CRM-linked performance model built in Google Sheets and connected to Geckoboard for visually appealing dashboards. Constraint-driven architecture tied directly to Salesforce activity. The system enforced logging, clarified roles, and made weekly performance reviews actionable and grounded.</p><br>

			<h2>Design & Rollout</h2>
			<p>I started by pulling historical activity from Salesforce and asking a simple question: what does good performance actually look like? I mapped conversion rates across each funnel stage to establish performance benchmarks grounded in actual pipeline behavior.</p><br>
			<p>The first version lived entirely in Google Sheets. I segmented metrics by role and mapped them to their respective funnel stages, from cold outreach and POEJOs (presentations on existing job orders) to interviews, offers, and placements. Every KPI was tied to CRM activity, and if it wasn’t logged, it didn’t count.</p><br>
			<p>The old system had made gaming easy, so adoption took deliberate coaching. One rep left the company after refusing to log activity. Others came around later, once a comp redesign tied payouts to CRM visibility and made enforcement unavoidable.</p><br>
			<p>The system evolved weekly. I added 7- and 30-day pacing views, automated team rollups, and built dashboards that made performance legible in standups and 1:1s. By the end of rollout, reps stopped arguing about data. They started coaching themselves off the numbers.</p><br>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>Salesforce was the system of record, but activity data on its own wasn’t usable at scale. I built a live integration that pulled activity logs into Google Sheets every five minutes, filtered by rep and role, and structured them into a clean, queryable dataset. From there, I layered in logic for pacing, benchmark tracking, and rolling forecasts.</p><br>
			<p>Geckoboard handled the display layer. Individual dashboards showed daily and weekly progress against role-specific KPIs, while team views were piped into TVs and used during standups. All dashboards refreshed automatically and pulled from CRM activity, the new source of truth.</p><br>
			<p>Enforcement happened in two layers: validation rules inside Salesforce that blocked incomplete entries, and later, comp rules directly tied to logged activity. The system also surfaced early signs of rep underperformance through rolling 7- and 30-day pacing views, which gave managers a clean runway to coach before metrics cratered.</p><br>

			<h2>Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Once the system stabilized, it became part of how the business operated. Daily dashboards replaced anecdotal updates in standups. Managers coached off pacing gaps instead of instincts. Forecasting shifted from gut feel to funnel math, anchored in real CRM data.</p><br>
			<p>Over four years, revenue scaled more than 6x. The KPI system didn’t just track growth, it enabled it. Reps could see exactly what good looked like, and leaders could plan with visibility into where revenue was coming from and when.</p><br>
			<p>Linking compensation to activity made the numbers real. Reps stopped treating logging as optional, because the system made it clear that data wasn’t just reporting, it was how they got paid. That shift in culture made KPI enforcement sustainable and adoption self-policing.</p><br>
			<p>When roles eventually specialized, the system held. Attribution became easier, coaching got more targeted, and performance reviews stopped being subjective. The system didn’t just survive the growth, it scaled with it.</p><br>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>This system wasn’t built with enterprise tools or a dedicated data team. It worked because it was grounded in CRM reality, enforced through comp, and evolved alongside the team. It showed that visibility and trust don’t require headcount or budget, just clear logic and consistent enforcement.</p><br>

			<ul class="case-study-list">
			  <li>CRM activity only matters if it’s enforced, surfaced, and paid on</li>
			  <li>KPI adoption accelerates when comp and dashboards reinforce the same truth</li>
			  <li>Dashboards alone don’t build trust, system integrity does</li>
			  <li>Attribution is a systems design problem, not just a reporting one</li>
			</ul><br>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>When COVID forced a sudden shift to remote work, it exposed a critical failure point in our sales infrastructure: our phone system was desk-bound and completely unscalable. The desk phones were Power-over-Ethernet, and it took 10 days to source replacement power supplies. During that window, we lost visibility into rep activity, call coaching broke down, and compliance risks mounted.</p><br>
			<p>I used the outage as a catalyst to redesign our voice infrastructure. We rolled out Dialpad org-wide, giving reps mobile-first access, seamless Salesforce logging, and automatic call recording for asynchronous coaching. Unlike our previous setup, which relied on reps logging and recording calls manually, this new stack was built for zero-friction accountability and scalable oversight.</p><br>
			<h2>Pitch & Selection</h2>
			<p>Our existing provider technically supported softphones and Salesforce plugins, but nothing worked unless reps followed brittle workflows and manually logged every call. After the 10-day outage, I made the case to leadership that patching the system wasn’t enough. We needed a platform that would work by default, and on top of that: one that didn’t rely on rep behavior to stay compliant.</p><br>
			<p>I reviewed vendors across key dimensions: OS-agnostic performance, Salesforce sync reliability, mobile usability, and call recording quality. Dialpad stood out for its native Salesforce integration and consistent experience across operating systems. It also offered automatic logging and recording out of the box, with no rep activation required.</p><br>
			<p>Once approved, I rolled it out org-wide to 13 users -- sales reps, support staff, and leadership -- with zero need for a staged pilot.</p><br>
			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>Once Dialpad was approved, I led the end-to-end rollout across the organization. We deployed the app across macOS, Windows, ChromeOS, iOS, and Android, ensuring full parity between desktop and mobile experiences. I also standardized headset hardware to reduce call quality variance between users.</p><br>
			<p>On the backend, I configured click-to-dial, automatic logging, and call recording sync into Salesforce. Every inbound and outbound call -- along with SMS activity -- was tied directly to Contact records, giving managers real-time visibility and a complete interaction history. Recordings were automatically saved and accessible for asynchronous coaching or quality review, with no manual rep involvement. Our team used the built-in commenting tools to tag moments in calls for follow-up, streamline feedback, and support ongoing rep development.</p><br>
			<p>I collaborated with leadership and account managers to redesign workflows for a remote-first model, ensuring reps could move seamlessly between office, home, and travel environments without breaking compliance or losing visibility. No manual logging. No shadow pipelines. Just automatic and scalable infrastructure.</p><br>
			<h2>Outcomes</h2>
			<p>The impact was immediate and measurable. Logged calls increased by 20%, driven by backend automation and the elimination of manual workflows. Reps no longer had to toggle between apps or remember to capture activity. Every call, text, and note flowed directly into Salesforce.</p><br>
			<p>Coaching improved as well. Managers could access recordings asynchronously, leave comments mid-call, and address performance issues without needing live shadowing or awkward ride-alongs. That made feedback faster, more consistent, and less disruptive to the sales day.</p><br>
			<p>Compliance risk dropped to zero. Reps stopped defaulting to personal phones, and all activity was captured inside the system. With full parity across desktop and mobile devices, our telephony stack became platform-agnostic, portable, and scalable. No matter where reps worked.</p><br>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>I went into this thinking we were just upgrading and modernizing a broken phone system. What I didn’t realize was how much leverage comes from voice infrastructure that actually integrates. Dialpad didn’t just fix portability, it gave us full visibility into rep activity, simplified coaching, and removed all the friction that used to get in the way of compliance.</p><br>
			<p>The real win was behavioral. When tools remove the need for rep discipline, they don’t just reduce overhead, they become invisible systems that enforce themselves.</p><br>

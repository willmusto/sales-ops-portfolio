    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Our outbound workflow had become a stumbling block. As a relationship-driven executive search firm, cold outreach was our lifeblood and how we built trust. However, our stack (PhoneBurner, Mailchimp, and a duct-taped Salesforce sync) added friction at every step. Reps avoided it, follow-up slipped, and we lost visibility into what was working.</p>
    <p>I had built that original stack myself, using PhoneBurner for dialing and Mailchimp for basic sequencing, because it was the fastest and cheapest way to get something live. It gave us a working model for cadence logic and helped prove that automated follow-up could move the needle. While it worked in the beginning and helped reps get used to structured follow-up, the cracks widened as the team grew.</p>
    <p>The sync only ran once a day, which meant the data was always a step behind. Admin-only backend controls slowed down fixes, and the picklist-heavy Salesforce UI frustrated reps. They stopped using the system, and we lost visibility into what was working.</p>

    <h2>Pitch & Pilot</h2>
    <p>I pitched Outreach as a way to consolidate our outbound workflow and secured a small budget for a five-rep pilot. Competition in our niche had exploded—more than 8 times as many firms had entered the space in under two years—and our call volume wasn’t keeping pace. Reps were underdelivering and pointing fingers at the system. To de-risk the rollout, I used our existing Mailchimp cadence structure to prototype Outreach logic, then scoped a pilot with clear activity benchmarks and revenue goals.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>I configured the Salesforce–Outreach integration, then built custom sequences for each rep based on their role. Everyone got a custom quick-start guide and targeted coaching to build confidence. We used Outreach University for baseline training and layered on contextual 1:1 support tied to activity KPIs. Adoption took time—about 180 days—but we made performance visible and coached in public. Once early wins surfaced, peer pressure did the rest.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📞 Outbound call volume increased 57% within the first few weeks</li>
      <li>📧 Follow-up email volume rose over 300%, driven by automated cadences</li>
      <li>🗓 SDR/CDR teams doubled meetings booked across the board</li>
      <li>⏱️ Reps spent less time manually logging activity and more time moving deals forward</li>
      <li>🔁 Outreach became the standard within six months, driven by peer pressure and visible results</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Outreach was a force multiplier, but only because we rebuilt trust in the system. At first, reps didn’t believe it would help them—they thought it was just another tool to learn. We had to prove it. We prototyped, piloted, coached, and stayed patient until the early wins started to land. Once reps saw their teammates booking more meetings and moving faster, the system finally clicked.</p>
    <p>This project reminded me that change management in Sales Ops is never just about software. It's about trust, visibility, and whether the system actually helps people do their jobs better. If it does, they’ll adopt it on their own—and if it doesn’t, no amount of pressure will matter.</p>

    <h2>🧐 Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adoption is behavioral, not technical.</strong> The rollout only stuck once reps saw their peers winning with the tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Tooling must earn trust.</strong> Even strong platforms get ignored if they feel overbearing or misaligned with rep workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Show the win.</strong> Peer pressure worked better than any top-down coaching once outcomes were visible.</li>
    </ul>

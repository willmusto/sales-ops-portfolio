			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>As a relationship-driven executive search firm, we relied on cold outreach to build trust and move passive candidates. Our stitched-together outbound stack (PhoneBurner + custom Mailchimp flows managed with a picklist-heavy Salesforce UI) had fallen apart. Once-a-day syncs were too infrequent, follow-up collapsed, and reps disengaged from the system completely.</p><br>
			<p>I scoped Outreach as a replacement and secured a partial budget to roll it out to five high-leverage reps. To earn the greenlight, I pulled historical data from when our Mailchimp workflows were properly followed. Structured follow-up had driven real pipeline lift.</p><br>
			<p>The results came fast: 57% more calls, 300%+ more follow-ups, and double the booked meetings. Adoption took deliberate effort. Coaching came first, but performance visibility and peer comparisons did the real heavy lifting.</p><br>

			<h2>Pitch & MVP Rollout</h2>
			<p>I built the case for Outreach by showing how it could solve three visible breakdowns: missed follow-up, low outbound volume, and siloed reporting. To prove the ROI, I pulled historical data from when our Mailchimp workflows were properly followed. Structured follow-up had driven real pipeline lift.</p><br>
			<p>Leadership approved a limited rollout: five licenses, no budget for a full migration. We prioritized reps in high-volume roles and tied the launch to outbound performance recovery. I mapped legacy cadence logic into Outreach, scoped sequences by role, and benchmarked the rollout against prior call and email volume.</p><br>
			<p>We didn’t frame it as a test. We framed it as the new standard, and built adoption pressure through 1:1 coaching and direct rep comparisons.</p><br>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>I configured Outreach to integrate with Salesforce using only Contact objects, avoiding any disruption to Opportunity workflows or core pipeline logic. Each rep was assigned sequences mapped to their role -- SDRs, CDRs, and Account Managers -- with cadences tailored to match target personas and funnel stages.</p><br>
			<p>To reduce manual entry overhead, I set up auto-logging for emails, calls, and tasks. Every interaction synced directly to Salesforce, keeping performance visible without additional rep effort. Sync rules were built to mirror our existing Salesforce structure without introducing Leads or breaking attribution logic.</p><br>
			<p>Training was a blend of Outreach University, job aids, and contextual 1:1 coaching. I supported reps through a 180-day adoption window, reviewing performance weekly and helping troubleshoot edge cases in real time. Usage was tracked in both Outreach and Salesforce, with adoption metrics folded into team reviews and rep-level performance checks.</p><br>

			<h2>Outcomes</h2>
			<ul class="case-study-list">
			  <li>Outbound call volume increased by 57% post-rollout</li>
			  <li>Follow-up volume more than tripled due to automated cadences</li>
			  <li>SDR and CDR teams doubled their booked meetings within 6 months</li>
			  <li>Time recovered from manual logging was reallocated to pipeline activity</li>
			  <li>Outreach became the default system for outbound motion due to improved rep performance and visibility</li>
			</ul><br>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>Outreach didn’t fix anything on its own. What worked was the system behind it: sequences built for real roles, activity logged without friction, and performance surfaced without debate. Adoption came from seeing the results and knowing the numbers were visible.</p><br>
			<p>This project reinforced the simple truth that adoption follows utility. If a tool saves time, enforces good behavior, and rewards execution, reps will use it.</p><br>

			<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			<ul class="case-study-list">
			  <li>Replaced fragmented call/email stack with Outreach to unify outbound activity</li>
			  <li>Used historical cadence performance to justify MVP rollout for five high-leverage reps</li>
			  <li>Configured Contact-only Salesforce sync to protect pipeline logic and enforce logging</li>
			  <li>Increased call volume by 57% and 3x’d follow-up, doubling meetings booked</li>
			  <li>Drove 180-day adoption through role-specific sequences, coaching, and performance visibility</li>
			</ul>
